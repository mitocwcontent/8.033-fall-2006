description: This resource contains lecture slides on defining Einstein field equations,
  Einstein tensor, stress-energy tensor, curvature scalar, Ricci tensor, Christoffel
  symbols, Riemann curvature tensor, symmetry arguments by which 6 Schwarzschild metric
  tensor components vanish, symmetry arguments for why the non-zero components are
  functions of radius only, the differential equations for G00 and G11, and shell
  radius vs. bookkeepers radial coordinate.
